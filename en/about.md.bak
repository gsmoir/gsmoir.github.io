My friends also call me Sam.
I am currently a Project Manager at [IIIT Manipur](http://iiitmanipur.ac.in/).

I hold a B.Tech. with **"Distinction"** in Computer Science & Engineering and am a PhD candidate.
I have around 8 years of experience with proven excellence in the field of Information-Technology (IT) and computer software engineering.

As a campus recruit in 2014, I worked for 3 years at [WIPRO technologies](https://www.wipro.com/) as a **"Project Engineer/Enterprise Platform Engineer"**, specialising in **Java**.
I was fortunate enough to be recognised as the **Best Campus Recruit** in the **PES Excellence Awards 2016-17**, and rated **"Excellent"** continuously in all the performance ratings.

From 2017 to 2020, I have engaged in freelancing and explored start-up ventures to bring IT solutions to the grass-roots level in the small state of Manipur, India.

Since 2020, I have been part of the [Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Manipur ](http://iiitmanipur.ac.in/) in conducting and managing R&D projects.
Currently, I am working as a Project Manager for an R&D project for Machine-Translation of Manipuri language.
During this stint, I designed and developed the **first mass usable Meetei-Mayek Keyboard interface** (published [IEEE research paper ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9573837/) on it and cited by [Google  NMT Researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03983)).
Also, I could contribute my technical skills to the IIIT Manipur team in developing the first-of-its kind **online multilingual dictionary cum thesaurus for Manipuri and four other languages of Manipur**.
The website is currently up and running at the [KangleiWordnet](http://kangleiwordnet.in).
Right now, I am dealing with cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques in Neural Machine Translation.

I have proven excellence in software development, maintenance, research, and managing projects in AGILE, CI/CD environment.
I am well versed in collaborating and communicating with teams, stakeholders, and clients.
I love to explore new ideas and solution capabilities with the magic of computer programming.

You will find me listening to music, playing guitar, writing or debating about some random stuff, or strolling with my near and dear ones when I am not working.
