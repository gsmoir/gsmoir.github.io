My friends also call me Sam. I am currently a Project Manager at IIIT Manipur. I hold a B.Tech with **Distinction** in Computer Science & Engineering, and a PhD candidate. I have around 8 years of experience with proven excellence in the field of Information Technology (IT)/Computer Software Engineering.

As a campus recruit in 2014, I worked for 3 years in WIPRO technologies as **"Project Engineer/Enterprise Platform Engineer"**, specialized in Java. I was fortunate enough to be recognized as **Best Campus Recruit in PES excellence Awards 2016-17**, and rated **Excellent** continuously in all the performance ratings.

From 2017 to 2020 I have engaged in freelancing and explored start-up ventures to bring IT solutions at grass-root level in the small state of Manipur, India.

Since 2020, I have been part of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Manipur in conducting and managing R&D projects. Currently, I am working as Project Manager for an R&D project for Machine Translation of Manipuri language. I have designed and developed **the first mass usable Meetei-Mayek Keyboard interface** during this stint (Published IEEE research paper on it). Also, the first of its kind **online multilingual dictionary cum thesaurus for Manipuri and four other languages of Manipur** was developed and currently up and running at the [Kangleiwordnet website](kangleiwordnet.in).
	
I am well experienced in software development, maintenance and managing projects in AGILE, CI/CD environment. I am currently dealing with cutting edge Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques in Machine Translation. I am well versed in managing, collaborating and communicating with teams, stakeholders and clients.

I am a keen and a fast learner of emerging technologies. I love to explore new ideas and solution capabilities with the magic called Computer programming.
